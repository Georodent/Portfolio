        <p class="about">George Roden was born in Hazelton,PA on August 9, 1974. George loves animals, traveling with his wife, making art and/or music, and is very compassionate toward all walks of life. He spent most of his life growing up in Keansburg, NJ. His father passed away when he was 16 and moved to Newport News,VA where he graduated High School. Choosing the path of being a musician, he played in a band for the majority of his youth while living in Virginia, and Louisiana. In the meantime he worked as an Auto Technician. So the story goes, the band didn't pan out so he continued to work as an Auto Technician for the next 20 years to make his living. His love for the arts never died, he still plays music to this day, and is currently in a band with his wife, whom he has been married to for 21 years. 
           He started learning coding in order to possibly switch careers. Auto work was becoming monotonous and boring. He began coding from tutorials on Youtube, and various websites that provided information on how to code. From there he took various one day classes, and also took a 9 month certification course for coding at UW in Seattle, WA. He finished and was certified in HTML and CSS. He still currently studies, and builds websites, and is learning Javascript now. 
              Growing up, George also worked with his father who was a carpenter. He learned the skills of carpentry, fabrication, and welding. Just some more skill sets to add to the list. Overall George is a hard worker, whatever task is in front of him, he will see it through, and do it as quickly and competently as possible. He lives for challenges, and doesn't like to get beat by anything, even though it sometimes happens to all of us.  </p>
